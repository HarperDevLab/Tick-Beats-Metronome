## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

- **Game Tick Synchronization**: Aligns both an Audio and Visual Metronome with game ticks.


- **Customizable Sounds**: Upgrade those bland ticks of standard metronomes to proper **Beats**! 
choose from various tick sounds to suit your preference.


- **Tick Smoothing**: If the jitter of RuneLite metronomes drives you crazy, tick smoothing is an
**optional** feature to eliminate jitter by predicting when game ticks should happen, it's not as 
accurate as the standard game tick based metronome which accounts for lag (hence the jitter), but 
it can be much more pleasant to listen to!

**Note:** it can take up to ~10 ticks after starting up for tick smoothing to accurately predict when game ticks, 
should happen, you can run it along with the regular RuneLite metronome plugin to test how accurate it is.

- **Multiple Beats**: Like to mix it up a bit? swap between multiple beats at the click of a hotkey
to keep things fresh!
