## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

- **Game Tick Synchronization**: Aligns both an Audio and Visual Metronome with game ticks.


- **Customizable Sounds**: Upgrade those bland ticks of standard metronomes to proper **Beats**! 
choose from various tick sounds to suit your preference.


- **Tick Smoothing**: If the jitter of RuneLite metronomes drives you crazy, tick smoothing is an
**optional** feature to eliminate jitter by predicting when game ticks should happen, it's not as 
accurate as the standard game tick based metronome which accounts for lag (hence the jitter), but 
it can be much more pleasant to listen to!

**Note:** it can take up to ~10 ticks after starting up for tick smoothing to accurately predict when game ticks, 
should happen, you can run it along with the regular RuneLite metronome plugin to test how accurate it is.

- **Multiple Beats**: Like to mix it up a bit? swap between multiple beats at the click of a hotkey
to keep things fresh!


- **NEW User Sound Support!**: Add up to 20 of your own sound effects to the metronome. Add any sounds you
like as .wav files to .runelite\tick-beats\sounds (this folder should be created when you start the plugin)

The User Sounds will be accessible by selecting "user sound 1" - "user sound 20" in the sound options dropdown.
The plugin pulls all .wav files from the folder and sorts them alphabetically so naming conventions aren't 
as rigid. So you can name your files "01kick.wav" "02snare.wav" or "AKick.wav" "BSnare.wav" if you want 
"user sound 1" to be your kick sound file and "user sound 2" to be your snare sound file. Or don't 
worry at all about naming conventions, toss all your .wav sounds (up to 20) in the folder and play with the different 
"user sound" options until you find the sound you're looking for!
